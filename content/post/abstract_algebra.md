## Section 4

A group \\( G \\):

1. Has an identity \\( e \\) where \\( ex = xe = x \space\space \forall x\in G \\)
2. Satisfies \\( \forall x \in G \\), there exists an inverse \\(x^{-1} \\) where \\( x^{-1}x = xx^{-1} = e \\)
3. Satisfies associative property \\( a(bc) = (ab)c \space\space \forall a, b, c \in G \\)

A group \\( \langle G, * \rangle \\) is isomorphic to another group \\( \langle H, *^\prime \rangle \\) if:

1. There is a well defined function, \\( f : G \rightarrow H \\)
2. \\( f(x * y) = f(x) *^\prime f(y) \\), the homomorphism property, is satisfied \\( \forall x, y \in G \\)
3. \\( f \\) is onto, which means if \\( y\in H \\), then there exists an \\( x\in G \\) such that \\( f(x) = y \\)
4. \\( f \\) is 1-1, which means if \\( f(x) = f(y) \\), then \\( x = y \\)

## Section 5

A subset \\( H \\) is a subgroup of \\( \langle G, * \rangle \\) if:

1. \\( H \\) is also closed under \\( * \\)
2. \\( H \\) has the same identity
3. \\( \forall a\in H \\), \\( a^{-1}\in H \\) too

A cyclic subgroup \\( \langle a \rangle = \\{ a^{n} \vert n \in \mathbb{Z} \\} \\) is the smallest subgroup containing \\( a \\).

## Section 6

A subgroup, \\( H \\), of a cyclic group, \\( G \\), is cyclic. The empty case works, and in the non-empty case, the subgroup is going to be generated by \\( a^m \\) where \\( m \\) is the smallest integer that satisfies \\( a^m \in H \\).

If \\( G \\) is a cyclic group, if its order is infinite, it's isomorphic to \\( \langle \mathbb{Z}, + \rangle \\). The isomorphism is \\( \phi(a^i) = i \\). If its order is \\( n \\), it's isomorphic to \\( \langle \mathbb{Z}_n, +_n \rangle \\). The isomorphism is \\( \phi(a^i) = i \bmod{n} \\).

A cyclic subgroup, \\( H = \langle a^m \rangle \\), of a cyclic group, \\( G = \langle a \rangle \\), is of order \\( x = n / \gcd(n, m) \\) where \\( \vert G \vert = n \\). This is because it satisfies the smallest \\( x \\) in \\( (a^m)^x = e = a^n \\).
