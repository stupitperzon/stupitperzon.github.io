## Section 4 - Groups

A group \\( G \\):

1. Has an identity \\( e \\) where \\( ex = xe = x \space\space \forall x\in G \\)
2. Satisfies \\( \forall x \in G \\), there exists an inverse \\(x^{-1} \\) where \\( x^{-1}x = xx^{-1} = e \\)
3. Satisfies associative property \\( a(bc) = (ab)c \space\space \forall a, b, c \in G \\)

A group \\( \langle G, * \rangle \\) is isomorphic to another group \\( \langle H, *^\prime \rangle \\) if:

1. There is a well defined function, \\( f : G \rightarrow H \\)
2. \\( f(x * y) = f(x) *^\prime f(y) \\), the homomorphism property, is satisfied \\( \forall x, y \in G \\)
3. \\( f \\) is onto, which means if \\( y\in H \\), then there exists an \\( x\in G \\) such that \\( f(x) = y \\). It feels like finding the \\( f^{-1}(y) \\) that yields \\( x \\)
4. \\( f \\) is one-to-one, which means if \\( f(x) = f(y) \\), then \\( x = y \\)

## Section 5 - Subgroups

A subset \\( H \\) is a subgroup of \\( \langle G, * \rangle \\) if:

1. \\( H \\) is also closed under \\( * \\)
2. \\( H \\) has the same identity
3. \\( \forall a\in H \\), \\( a^{-1}\in H \\) too

A cyclic subgroup \\( \langle a \rangle = \\{ a^{n} \vert n \in \mathbb{Z} \\} \\) is the smallest subgroup containing \\( a \\).

## Section 6 - Cyclic groups

A subgroup, \\( H \\), of a cyclic group, \\( G \\), is cyclic. Sketch of proof: The empty case works, and in the non-empty case, the subgroup is going to be generated by \\( a^m \\) where \\( m \\) is the smallest integer that satisfies \\( a^m \in H \\).

If \\( G \\) is a cyclic group, if its order is infinite, it's isomorphic to \\( \langle \mathbb{Z}, + \rangle \\). The isomorphism is \\( \phi(a^i) = i \\). If its order is \\( n \\), it's isomorphic to \\( \langle \mathbb{Z}_n, +_n \rangle \\). The isomorphism is \\( \phi(a^i) = i \bmod{n} \\).

A cyclic subgroup, \\( H = \langle a^m \rangle \\), of a cyclic group, \\( G = \langle a \rangle \\), is of order \\( x = n / \gcd(n, m) \\) where \\( \vert G \vert = n \\). This is because it satisfies the smallest \\( x \\) in \\( (a^m)^x = e = a^n \\).

## Section 8 - Permutation groups

An example of a permutation \\( \sigma \\) is
\\(
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\\\
2 & 1 & 3
\end{pmatrix}
\\),
where the first element is mapped to the second, the second element is mapped to the first, and third is mapped to itself. Permutations can be composed like \\( (\sigma \sigma) (1) = \sigma (\sigma (1)) = \sigma (2) = 1 \\). The set of all permutations of any set \\( A \\) forms the symmetric group \\( S_A \\) with the composition operation. A subgroup of \\( S_A \\) is the permutation group.

The nth dihedral group \\( D_n \\) is the group of symmetries of the regular n-gon. Rotations, mirror images, and diagonal flips characterize its elements, which form a subgroup of \\( S_n \\).

Cayley's Theorem states every group is isomorphic to a permutation group. This is not the same as saying every group isomorphic to a symmetric group, as symmetric groups contain \\( n! \\) elements and there are groups that don't contain \\( n! \\) elements, like \\( D_4 \\). The isomorphism is \\( \phi(x) : G \rightarrow S_G = \lambda_x \\), where \\( \lambda_x : G \rightarrow G = xg \space\space \forall g\in G \\). It means that an element in a set can be used to shuffle the set into a new permutation. Because \\( \phi(x) \\) is one-to-one and \\( \phi(xy) = \phi(x)\phi(y) \space\space \forall x, y \in G \\), the image of \\( G \\) under \\( \phi \\), or \\( \phi[G] = \\{ \phi(g) \vert g\in G \\} \\), is a subgroup of \\( S_G \\) and \\( \phi \\) is an isomorphism relating \\( G \\) with \\( \phi[G] \\).

## Section 9 - Orbits and Alternating Groups

The orbits are the partitions/equivalence classes of a set by a permutation. \\( a, b \in A \\) are in the same orbit if \\( a = \sigma^n (b) \\) where \\( \sigma \\) is the permutation. That is an equivalence relation (reflexive, symmetric, and transitive). An orbit of length two is a transposition and all orbits of length greater than two can be expressed as a product of transpositions.

A cycle \\( (1, 2) \\) in \\( S_3 \\) can be expressed as a permutation like
\\(
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\\\
2 & 1 & 3
\end{pmatrix}
\\). Basically, interchange 1 and 2 and fix 3. Multiplying two cycles would be the composition of two permutations.

A permutation in \\( S_n \\) can either be expressed as an odd or even number of transpositions. That is, a transposition \\( (i, j) \\) multiplied with an orbit will either split the orbit if it was already part of it or join two orbits together if the transposition and the orbit were disjoint. A subgroup of \\( S_n \\) of even permutations is the alternating group \\( A_n \\).

## Section 10 - Cosets and Lagrange's Theorem

If \\( H \\) is a subgroup of \\( G \\), \\( G \\) will be divided into \\( \lvert G \rvert / \lvert H \rvert \\) disjoint partitions/subgroups/equivalence classes called cosets. The number of partitions is also known as the index \\( ( G : H ) \\). The left coset of \\( H \\) containing \\( a \\) is \\( \\{ ah \vert h \in H \\} \\).

If \\( H = 3\mathbb{Z} \\) and \\( G = \mathbb{Z} \\), the cosets would be \\( 0 + 3\mathbb{Z} = \\{0, 3, 6, ... \\} \\), \\( 1 + 3\mathbb{Z} = \\{ 1, 4, 7... \\} \\), ...

Reordering a Cayley table, grouping together elements in cosets and compressing those elements to new ones, gives rise to coset groups.

Lagrange's Theorem is the order of a subgroup \\( H \\) must be a divisor of \\( G \\). This is because every coset has the same order as \\( H \\), because \\( \phi(a) = ah \vert h \in H \\), which converts one coset into another, is one-to-one and onto.
