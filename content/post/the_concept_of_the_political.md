title: "The Concept of the Political"
---

_The Concept of the Political_ was written by Carl Schmitt in 1932. It defines the political as situations where there are clear friend-enemy distinctions. The schism in opinions is usually in the central domain of the time. The central domain is defined as the domain which captures the attention of the best minds. From the 16th to 20th centuries, the central domains shifted from religion to metaphysics to economics and finally to technology. Each central domain during its prominence was seen as the most neutral, being less likely to cause war than the previous, but nevertheless, they still happen. When a war happens, the political becomes central, and the previous central domain becomes secondary. All previous central domains continue to inspire meaning in people's lives, meaning domains are pluralistic, even if they've become secondary. They, instead of being an instrument of the state, retreat into the private sphere. The central domain of technology during 1932 is quasi-neutral, and because it serves all of humanity, it is used as a tool to sharpen conflicts in secondary domains. Because of technology's non-direct relations to the political, its status as the dominant domain leads to meaninglessness. Critiquing technism critiques liberalism. It follows then that rising liberal attitudes correlate with widespread depression.

The political exists because of man's dangerous nature, a view every political theorist presupposes, especially Hobbes. Though the nature of singular man is relevant here, at scale, this view becomes the basis of the political, the view that man is dangerous in groups. Hobbes sought to conquer this nature of man by advocating for absolute sovereignty, the view that man should not be trusted and that only a strong leader could keep in check the brutishness of man. The re-education of man to not be so naturally dangerous has its roots in liberalism, whose eventual goal is to erase the existence of the political and for there to be global peace. Liberals are typically apolitical and believe in neutrality. Schmitt, in a thought experiment, thinks the long term goal of liberalism will lead to the worst and final war of all, a war between pacifists and non-pacifists, especially if liberals are serious about maintaining peace. He also thinks that liberals are silly to believe that man's nature is good-hearted. Liberal societies who inhabited this mindset were decayed and violently usurped, such as the French bourgeoisie before the French revolution in the 18th century.

The state is usually defined as a sovereign, independent group of people living inside territorial boundaries. The state has become synonymous with the political, for the head of state is the power that decides the friend-enemy distinction. Until the distinction is made clear, the political doesn't exist. Because the state protects its citizens and grants them rights, it demands obedience in return. The obedience in terms of the political indicates an individual obligation to fight for the survival of the way of living inside the state. Of course, surviving is the most important for the survival of the state, but fighting the enemy is of next importance. The friend-enemy distinction is created when the way of living is threatened with respect to usually the central domain between two states. The enemy may be respected morally, aesthetically, and technologically, but if they were capitalist while we were communist in the age when economics was the central domain, we would potentially war or consciously decide against it. An enemy in one conflict may become a friend in the next.
